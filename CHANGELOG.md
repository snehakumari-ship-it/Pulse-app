# Changelog — V1 (v0.0.01)

## sneha/V1.0.3 — 2026-10-05
- **What:** Supplier bank and Advance Processed (Verified→Settled only; Pending Docs / Compliance Pending unchanged):
  - Supplier Banking: Beneficiary and Branch on the vault form. IFSC lookup fills bank and branch. Saving updates the Advance Processed table, Verified export, and the Paid to card live.
  - Migration `20261005080754_add_bank_account_beneficiary_branch.sql` adds `beneficiary_name` and `branch_name` on `entity_bank_accounts` (already applied on preprod; Nihas owns remote apply).
  - Advance Processed table: Trip, LR, Truck, Payment type, Supplier, Beneficiary, Bank, IFSC, Account, Branch, Mode, Date, Amount, Request ID, UTR.
  - Advance Processed Export Report (that stage only): confirm card with counts, then an .xlsx with those columns. Verified export also gained Beneficiary Name; other Verified columns unchanged.
  - Paid to card on the Advance Payment panel: supplier, beneficiary, account, IFSC, bank, branch for the trip.
- **Why:** Finance needs the payee bank details on the Advance Processed list, export, and payment panel, kept in step with the supplier vault.
- **Files/areas:** supplier vault + IFSC lookup + bank events; Advance Processed table / export / payee card; Verified export beneficiary; `app/compliance/index.tsx`
- **Migrations:** `supabase/migrations/20261005080754_add_bank_account_beneficiary_branch.sql` (applied on preprod; tell Nihas)
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` + IFSC util. Web UI used during the round. `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1).

## sneha/V1.0.3 — 2026-10-05
- **What:** A verified trip now stays in **Verified** until its advance is paid from there, whether the hard-copy POD is pending or received. Two gaps that let a trip skip Verified are closed:
  - **Finance client receipts:** a client receipt posted in Finance (`trips.amount_paid`) no longer counts as the compliance advance. The `advanceFromTripReceipts` fallback is removed.
  - **Advance before verification:** a `compliance_advance` row posted before `compliance_verified_at` (like 000504's) no longer counts. Only an advance posted at or after verification moves the trip to Advance Processed. Rows now carry `postedAt` (`transactions.created_at`) for this check.
  - **Blocked Pay:** a verified trip that has a pre-verification advance shows in Verified with Pay blocked: "An advance of ₹… was posted before compliance was verified. Ask Finance to reverse it, then post the advance from Verified." Without this, Pay would show and then fail as a duplicate.
  - **Unchanged:** Compliance Pending, Pending Docs, and the move from Advance Processed to Balance Pending.
- **Why:** The advance is based only on compliance marking the trip Verified. Before this change, a receipt or an early advance plus a received POD sent a newly verified trip straight to Balance Pending.
- **Files/areas:**
  - `features/tripCompliance/services/tripComplianceRead.service.ts` (`summarizeComplianceTrip`, `isAdvancePostedAfterVerification`, `toPaymentSummary`, ledger selects)
  - `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceReadiness.util.ts` (advance lane)
  - `features/tripCompliance/tripCompliance.types.ts` (`postedAt`, `advanceBeforeVerification`)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:**
  - Jest `features/tripCompliance` + `lib/queries`: 44 suites, 509 tests pass. New tests:
    - Posted before, at, and after verification.
    - A pre-verification advance stays in Verified with POD pending or received, with no pill and Pay blocked with the reason.
    - A receipt-only verified trip stays in Verified and is ready for the advance.
    - An advance posted after verification goes to Advance Processed.
  - Preprod (read-only): all 15 verified trips keep their current tab. The 2 in Advance Processed had their advance posted after verification, and no verified trip relied on a Finance receipt.
  - `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1). ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.3 — 2026-10-05
- **What:** No compliance advance until the trip is compliance-verified (`trips.compliance_verified_at` set by `mark_trip_compliance_verified` or `approve_trip_compliance_with_exception`).
  - **Display:** `summarizeComplianceTrip` keeps `summary.advance` null on an unverified trip, both for a tagged `compliance_advance` row and for a Finance receipt (`trips.amount_paid`). The trip stays on Compliance Pending, gets no "Advance Processed" pill, and Pay / Bulk advance stay blocked through the existing readiness check. `deriveComplianceStage` is unchanged. Once the trip is verified, the existing advance shows and the trip moves to Advance Processed.
  - **Write:** `postCompliancePayment` (single and bulk) now reads the live `compliance_verified_at` / `pod_received_at` from `trips` before the existing prerequisite check, instead of trusting the cached trip object. If that read fails, it falls back to the cached trip. Same rule, same single ledger write path. Balance is still gated only by the POD rule.
- **Why:** SAT812GOGTRIP000504 (Gogovan India, preprod; DB `sequence_number` 503, trip `9f56df16…`) is in transit and never verified, yet has a ₹1,14,500 `compliance_advance` (txn `578b883e…`, created 2026-10-01 11:14 UTC by satham@gogovan.co.in). It showed as Advance Processed.
  - Live preprod check (read-only): the restrictive `compliance_advance_requires_compliance_approved` insert/update policies (migration 20260921125437, 4 statements recorded) are present for `authenticated`. RLS is enabled. There is no insertable view on `transactions`, and no SECURITY DEFINER function writes `compliance_advance`.
  - The trip was last updated at 03:45 UTC, before the insert, so it was never verified and then cleared. An authenticated app insert would be rejected today. The row was therefore written either before the policy was on preprod, or outside RLS (service role / SQL editor). This is the only unverified trip with a compliance advance on preprod.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/services/tripComplianceRead.service.ts` (`summarizeComplianceTrip`, doc comments), `features/tripCompliance/services/tripComplianceWrite.service.ts` (`readComplianceLedgerFlags`, `postCompliancePayment`)
- **Migrations:** none. The live policy is present and restrictive. The stray preprod row is left as is; removing it is a data decision for Nihas.
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (39 suites, 480 pass). New tests:
  - Advance rejected when the live `verified_at` is null, even if the cached trip says verified, and allowed when the live value is set.
  - Bulk rejects an unverified row and posts a verified one.
  - Balance is not gated beyond POD.
  - A 000504-shaped trip stays on Compliance Pending with no pill and no Pay; the verified version moves to Advance Processed.

  Full Jest: the only failures are 6 suites outside compliance (sign-in, chat, log-pods, network, platform-identity). `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1). ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## nihas/V1.0.15 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** Trips search finds an indent by its code even when that indent is older than the first 500 loaded rows. A paid test marketplace fee can be refunded and the award revoked together. Razorpay and cash payments stay blocked and the award stays awarded.
- **Why:** Searching SAT812GOGIND000788 showed no trips because the indent never loaded. Revoke on SAT812GOGIND000870 failed because the ₹3,600 test fee was already paid.
- **Files/areas:** Trips search, Award revoke, marketplace fee
- **Migrations:** `20270930235100_refund_test_marketplace_fee_and_revoke_indent.sql` (applied on preprod)
- **Tested:** Jest on indent-code search, the refund confirmation, the error messages, and the migration SQL. Not clicked through on preprod.

## nihas/V1.0.14 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** Compliance Pending table drops Payment and adds Invoice, LR, and Truck No. Extra e-way bills and LRs show as +N on the card and in the table, and every number is written in the Excel export. Table export follows the current stage, search, and date sort, and a toast states what is being downloaded.
- **Why:** The pending queue does not use the payment column, and a single truncated number hid the rest of the bills and LRs.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance table, Compliance cards, Compliance export
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest on document numbers and the Compliance Pending table columns. Export not clicked through on preprod.

## nihas/V1.0.13 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** Compliance Pending cards show the trip status (Loading, In Transit, Completed) next to the compliance pill. The table puts that status in its own Trip Status column and hides Advance and Balance on that tab only.
- **Why:** The pending queue only showed the compliance stage, so a completed trip looked the same as one still moving. Advance and Balance are not used on this tab.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance cards, Compliance table
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest on the status label and the Compliance Pending table columns. Not clicked through on preprod.

## nihas/V1.0.12 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** Approving trip, driver, or vehicle documents updates the screen immediately and keeps the Approved mark when you switch tabs. Verify and document approve skip the request queue. A compliance-verified trip stays on the Verified list until advance is posted or hard-copy POD is received, including when the trip is already completed.
- **Why:** Switching tabs cleared the approval before the save came back, and Verify timed out behind document previews. Completed trips were only listed under Payment Pending.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance document review, Verified queue, Supabase request gate
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest on the request gate and compliance review actions. Verified list checked locally (5 trips).

## nihas/V1.0.11 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** The Compliance screen waits for a signed-in session before looking up truck types and supplier names, and stops mid-way if the session drops. The document view reuses the page's lookups instead of running them a second time.
- **Why:** Preprod logs showed 41 "permission denied" errors in one second: per-trip lookups fired with no user token. These RPCs are signed-in only. The doc view also doubled the calls.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance list trip facts, Compliance document workspace
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** tsc at the 141 baseline, compliance Jest suites, full Jest run. Not clicked through on preprod.

## nihas/V1.0.10 — 2026-10-05

- **What:** Destination search on New Lane Contract accepts typing.
- **Why:** The place sheet was mounted outside the lane dialog, so the dialog focus trap pulled the cursor out of the search box.
- **Files/areas:** Place picker overlay, lane contract destination
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** unit test for the overlay host. Live lane form not clicked through in this session.

## nihas/V1.0.8 — 2026-10-02

- **What:** Unverified trips stay in Pending Docs while a required file is missing, and in Compliance Pending once every required file is in, including holds. A completed trip also stays listed in Awaiting POD until hard-copy is marked.
- **Why:** Delivered trips were only in Awaiting POD, so Compliance Pending showed a couple of rows. The doc lane and the POD lane now overlap.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance stage derivation
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest on compliance stage derivation.

## V1 merge fix — 2026-10-01

- **What:** Mobile load detail accepts the per-MT and trip-total rate lines from the indent card.
- **Why:** Praveen's partial-POD merge passed those rates into the stacked card, and the mobile detail type did not have them.
- **Files/areas:** `features/indents/components/IndentMobileLoadDetail.tsx`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** `tsc` back to the 141 baseline.

## praveen/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01

- **What:** A trip stays in Partial Received POD while any LR is still pending, and moves to the fully received POD stage only after every LR is received. Awaiting POD shows Received LRs and Pending LRs, matches Trip Operations Delivered, and keeps Log Hard Copy POD on that tab.
- **Why:** Receiving some LRs was marking the whole trip received.
- **Files/areas:** Compliance Awaiting POD, Log Hard Copy POD, trip hub delivered count
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest — LR receipt, awaiting-POD groups, hard-copy POD pipeline. Web session was not signed in here, so the live Compliance screen was not clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.3 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Fixed "Couldn't post payment: Compliance must be approved before an advance payment can be posted" on trips already in the Verified stage. The stage comes from the live trip compliance flags (`fetchComplianceTripFlags`, also patched instantly on verify). The payment pre-check reads `summary.trip.compliance_verified_at` from the trips-list row, which could be stale (e.g. right after auto-verify) or not carry the column. `summarizeComplianceTrip` now copies the live `compliance_verified_at` and `pod_received_at` onto `summary.trip`, so the stage, Confirm payment, Bulk Payment and the balance POD check all read the same values. The server-side RLS rule on `transactions` is unchanged and still enforces both.
- **Why:** SAT812GOGTRIP000122 showed Verified / Ready to pay but Confirm payment was refused by the client pre-check.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/services/tripComplianceRead.service.ts` (`summarizeComplianceTrip`)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (37 suites pass; new regression test: stale trip row + verified flags gives Verified stage and `summary.trip.compliance_verified_at` set, including after the instant verify patch); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet re-clicked.

## nihas/V1.0.6 — 2026-10-01

### What
Compliance Hold lists every trip compliance declined and has not yet verified, including ones still in Pending Docs.

### Why
The hold chip only looked inside Compliance Pending, so a decline on a trip that was still missing a file never appeared. Gogovan’s earlier declines also had their flags cleared when the decline columns were recreated; those three rows need the flags put back from the decline events.

### Files / areas
- `app/compliance/index.tsx`

### Migrations
None. Preprod data: restore `compliance_declined_*` on SAT812GOGTRIP000120, 000396, and 000408 from `compliance.declined` events.

### Tested
Filter change only. Data restore is a one-off preprod update.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Advance Payment panel, Verified-stage **Rejected** trips: the status still shows Blocked with the reasons, and below the reasons box there is now a compact row: a muted hint "Trip is rejected. You can still post the advance." on the left and a small dark **Confirm payment** button (32pt high) on the right. Pressing it opens the usual inline payment form (supplier facts, amount calculation with slab doc charges and TDS, payment mode) with **Cancel** and **Confirm payment** centered below. Cancel closes the form; switching trips resets it. Shown only when no advance is posted yet and the user can manage finance. The existing posting path is used, so duplicate-advance and amount checks still apply. Non-rejected trips and the normal Ready-to-pay form are unchanged.
- **Why:** Finance needs to be able to pay the advance on a trip even after compliance has rejected it.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (`ChecklistAdvancePaymentPanel`), `features/tripCompliance/components/CompliancePaymentConfirmModal.tsx` (inline Cancel, only when `onCancel` is passed)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (450 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Export Report "Driver No." now always comes from the trip driver's Driver Profile phone (Contact Registry → Phone Registry, `drivers.phone`). The bulk lookup by `trips.driver_id` still runs first. Any driver it returns without a phone (RLS-hidden or failed read) is filled from `get_driver_detail_bundle`, the same source the Driver Profile page uses. Numbers are written in the profile's format, `+91XXXXXXXXXX`, whether stored as 10 digits, `91…` or `0…`; non-Indian numbers are kept as stored. In the .xlsx they are text cells, so Excel never shows `9.19877E+11`. Account No is still written as a text cell with the exact stored value: no masking, no exponential form, leading zeros kept.
- **Why:** Driver No. was missing or garbled in the downloaded report. Driver No. and Account No must open in Excel exactly as they are on file.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/services/complianceExportReport.service.ts` (driver phone fallback), `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceVerifiedExport.util.ts` (`formatExportPhone`)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (450 pass; phone formats, Driver No. cell, .xlsx text cells for Account No / IFSC / phone); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean; no new import cycles. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Export Report now downloads an Excel workbook (`compliance-verified-report_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.xlsx`, sheet "Verified Report") instead of a CSV. The 26 columns are unchanged, in the same order (TRIP ID … Margin %). Account No, IFSC No, Driver No., LR No, invoice No, Trip ID, Truck No and every other non-money column are written as **text cells**. Excel can no longer show account numbers as `1.23E+15` or drop leading zeros; the exact value is shown, unmasked. Money and percent columns (C Price, S Price, % of advance, Documentation charges, TDS, Final Advance, Margin, Margin %) stay real numbers with `#,##0.00` / `0.0` formats, so they can be summed. Each column is sized to its longest value and the header row has a filter. "Verification status" now says **Rejected** for verified trips with a Reject remark, matching the cards and the popup. Web downloads the file; iOS and Android open the share sheet with the Excel type.
- **Why:** In Excel the CSV turned long account numbers into exponential form and lost leading zeros, which breaks bank payouts.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceVerifiedExport.util.ts` (`buildVerifiedExportWorksheet`, `buildVerifiedExportWorkbook`), `features/tripCompliance/services/complianceExportReport.service.ts` (xlsx download/share)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (449 pass; new test writes and re-reads an .xlsx and checks that `0012345678901234` stays a text cell, IFSC / phone / LR stay text, Final Advance stays a number, Rejected label); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean; no new import cycles. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** The Export Report popup no longer shows "N documents ready to be downloaded". It shows two equal tiles, **Verified** (green dot) and **Rejected** (red dot), each with its trip count, and a line below: "N trips will be included in the report". A count is coloured only when it is above zero. Rejected uses the same rule as the red card and the Verified-stage filter. Confirm is enabled when the stage has at least one trip; the empty hint is unchanged. The CSV export itself is unchanged.
- **Why:** The trip split is what compliance needs before exporting; the document total wasn't useful.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceExportConfirmModal.tsx`, `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceExportReport.util.ts` (`countVerifiedStageTrips`), `app/compliance/index.tsx`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (447 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean; no new import cycles. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance Verified stage (card view): a segmented filter with All / Verified / Rejected and a count on each sits pinned above the trip cards. The green and red dots match the card pills. "Rejected" uses the same rule as the red card (verified trip with a Reject remark). "Verified" covers every other trip in the stage, including Exception. The filter runs before pagination, so pages stay full. It resets to All when you leave the Verified stage or switch to Table, and it is hidden while searching, because search covers the whole queue. Other stages and the table view are unchanged.
- **Why:** Let compliance quickly separate rejected trips from clean verified ones in the Verified stage.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceVerifiedOutcomeFilter.tsx` (new), `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (optional `listHeader` slot, nothing rendered unless passed), `utils/complianceCardVisual.util.ts` (`isComplianceVerifiedRejected`, `matchesComplianceVerifiedOutcome`), `app/compliance/index.tsx`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (446 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Advance Payment panel: Documentation charges now come from the org's Document Charge Slabs (Workspace → Settings → Document Charges) instead of a fixed ₹0. The slab is matched on **base freight only**; slab edges are inclusive and the last slab means "and above". Example: base freight ₹5,250 falls in the ₹1,000–₹15,000 slab, so the charge is ₹200 and the payable at 90% is ₹4,725 − ₹200 = ₹4,525. The row now has the same layout as TDS: a hint under the label (e.g. "Slab ₹1,000 – 15,000 · on base freight", "No slab covers this base freight", "Document charges are off for this org") and a loader while the slabs are fetched. Confirm payment is disabled until the slabs load. On a balance payment the charge is ₹0 with the hint "Deducted with the advance", so it is never taken twice. The Verified Export Report CSV uses the same lookup for "Documentation charges" and "Final Advance".
- **Why:** The form always showed ₹0 for documentation charges. It should charge the configured slab for the trip's freight.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/utils/compliancePaymentAmount.util.ts` (`resolveComplianceDocumentationCharge`), `features/tripCompliance/components/CompliancePaymentConfirmModal.tsx` (slab fetch + Documentation charges row), `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceVerifiedExport.util.ts`, `features/tripCompliance/services/complianceExportReport.service.ts`, tests
- **Migrations:** none. Reads the existing `org_document_charge_settings` / `org_document_charge_slabs` tables (RLS: org members).
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (444 pass; new cases for slab edges, open-ended slab, off / no match, and the CSV Final Advance); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance footer: Export Report shows only when the Verified stage chip is selected and is hidden on every other stage. Bulk Payment stays right-aligned. If the stage changes while the export popup is open, the popup closes (unless an export is already running). The popup, its count and the CSV export are unchanged.
- **Why:** The report exports Verified-stage trips only, so offering it on other stages was misleading.
- **Files/areas:** `app/compliance/index.tsx` (footer Export Report button, `ComplianceExportConfirmModal` visibility)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Advance Payment panel: Reject and Confirm payment are centered under the cards (below the divider) and smaller: Reject 96×36, Confirm payment 168×36, radius 10, 10pt gap. Touch targets stay 44pt through `hitSlop`.
- **Why:** The full-width, right-heavy buttons looked oversized and off-center against the cards.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/CompliancePaymentConfirmModal.tsx` (inline action row)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Advance Payment panel: the Payment mode chips now span the full width under the Supplier and Amount calculation cards, lining up with both cards' edges. Reject and Confirm payment move to their own row below, under a hairline divider. On wide panels that row sits exactly under the Amount calculation column (same 10pt gutter); on narrow panels it spans the full width.
- **Why:** The mode chips and action buttons were squeezed into one row and didn't line up with the cards above.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/CompliancePaymentConfirmModal.tsx` (inline layout)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance workspace: removed the Pay button from the footer under the document preview. That footer now shows only the previous / next arrows, right-aligned, and is hidden when there is only one document. Payment is still done from the Advance Payment panel.
- **Why:** Duplicate entry point. Payment already lives in the Advance Payment panel next to Reject.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (preview footer)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance workspace: moved the trip Reject button from under the document preview into the Advance Payment panel. It sits in the same row as Confirm payment: Reject (108pt) then Confirm payment, both 44pt tall. When the payment form isn't shown (advance already paid or not ready), Reject sits on its own right-aligned row in the panel. The preview footer now keeps only Pay and the previous / next arrows.
- **Why:** Rejecting a verified trip is a payment-stage decision, so it belongs next to Confirm payment, not under the document viewer.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/CompliancePaymentConfirmModal.tsx` (inline `onReject` slot), `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (Advance Payment panel actions, preview footer)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## nihas/V1.0.5 — 2026-10-01

### What
A compliance decline that was later verified no longer shows as finance Rejected.

### Why
SAT812GOGTRIP000526 was declined by compliance (Dinesh, reason "test") and then verified. The old decline timestamp was kept as history, so the card said Rejected and the Declined-by-finance filter included it.

### Files / areas
- `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceTableStatus.util.ts`
- `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceCardVisual.util.ts`
- `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx`

### Migrations
None.

### Tested
`npx jest features/tripCompliance/__tests__/complianceTableStatus.util.test.ts features/tripCompliance/__tests__/complianceCardVisual.util.test.ts --ci --silent`

## nihas/V1.0.4 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** A compliance decline shows a Compliance Hold tag and the remark on the trip card. Compliance Pending has sub-filters for Compliance Hold and Declined by finance. A trip stays in Pending Docs until LR, E-way, Invoice, RC, Insurance, Fitness, and Licence are all on file. The search box lines up with the stage tabs.
- **Why:** Declined trips were hard to spot, and Compliance Pending included trips that were still missing required files.
- **Files/areas:** `app/compliance/index.tsx`, `complianceCardVisual.util.ts`, `tripComplianceRead.service.ts`, `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (445 pass); full Jest still the 5 known failing suites; typecheck still 141 errors

## nihas/V1.0.3 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Approving a vehicle or driver document no longer asks for an expiry date. A verified insurance, fitness, or licence stays verified when no date is stored.
- **Why:** Compliance was blocked on an expiry prompt before Approve could finish.
- **Files/areas:** `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx`, `complianceDocumentRows.util.ts`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `complianceDocumentRows.util.test.ts`, `complianceReviewActions.util.test.ts`

## nihas/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** The Compliance Review modal is removed. Pending, document review, and the trip details screen all open the card view on the Trip, Vehicle, or Driver tab. The Compliance Pending preview row keeps Trip Detail and always shows Verify and Decline. Verify moves the trip only after required documents on those three tabs are approved.
- **Why:** Approving the trip documents was sending the trip to Verified on its own, before the other tabs were done.
- **Files/areas:** `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx`, `complianceReviewActions.util.ts`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `complianceReviewActions.util.test.ts`

## nihas/V1.0.2 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Member access: the Compliance preset now turns the Compliance switch on. Turning that switch on no longer relabels the member as TripOps. The switch lists verify / mark verified / settlement / hard-copy POD. Payments stay off unless toggled on their own.
- **Why:** The Compliance switch was a different list (KYC, audit, trip docs). Selecting the preset left it off, and flipping it rewrote the role to TripOps because Compliance is not derived from the Operations domain.
- **Files/areas:** `lib/memberSurfaces.ts`, `features/organization/utils/teamInviteRoles.util.ts`, `MemberPermissionsPanel`, `DomainPermissionToggleRow`
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `lib/__tests__/rbac.memberAccess.test.ts`

## sneha/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance workspace: removed the per-document Approve / Decline buttons from the preview footer in every stage. Review now happens only through the Required / Optional group buttons in the document list. The footer keeps trip Reject / Pay and the previous / next arrows, right-aligned, and is hidden when none of them apply.
- **Why:** Two sets of Approve / Decline on one screen was confusing. One place to decide keeps the flow clean.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (footer, plus removal of the single-document approve / decline / auto-advance code and its styles)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance Finance tab: Memo is marked Required (red pill). Other Documents and Bank Docs stay Optional. The headline reads "1 required document not uploaded" while Memo is missing.
- **Why:** Memo is mandatory paperwork for the advance payment.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/tripCompliance.types.ts` (`REQUIRED_COMPLIANCE_FINANCE_DOCUMENT_TYPES`), `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceDocumentRows.util.ts` (`deriveFinanceDocumentRows`)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance Trip tab lists only LR, E-way Bill and Invoice. POD and Memo are removed from it (Memo stays under Finance, POD under Hardcopy POD). Rows under a Required / Optional group header no longer repeat a "Required" / "Optional" pill.
- **Why:** POD and Memo cluttered the Trip vault and showed an "Optional documents · 0 of 2 uploaded" block that wasn't actionable there.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceDocumentRows.util.ts` (new `deriveTripVaultReviewRows`), `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (Trip list + Trip tab badge), `ComplianceDocumentReviewSheet.tsx` (Trip scope)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (439 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance workspace: Upload / Replace on the Trip, Vehicle and Driver tabs now opens the file picker and uploads in place, with a spinner on the row. It no longer pops up the full "Compliance Review" sheet.
- **Why:** Clicking Upload opened the cramped review sheet instead of letting the user pick a file.
- **Files/areas:** new `features/tripCompliance/services/complianceVaultUpload.service.ts` (pick + validate + trip / vehicle-vault / entity-doc write, moved out of the review sheet), `ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (inline upload), `ComplianceDocumentReviewSheet.tsx` (uses the shared service)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (438 pass); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean. Web upload not yet clicked through.

## sneha/V1.0.1 — 2026-10-01
- **What:** Compliance workspace: one Approve / Decline pair per Required and Optional group under the Trip, Vehicle and Driver tabs. It appears once every doc in that group is uploaded. When the last required trip doc is approved, the trip moves to Verified automatically, with an inline "moving to Verified" notice.
- **Why:** Ops had to approve each doc separately from the preview footer and then press Mark verified by hand.
- **Files/areas:** `features/tripCompliance/components/ComplianceDocumentWorkspace.tsx` (grouped list, shared approve/decline writers, auto-verify), `features/tripCompliance/utils/complianceReviewActions.util.ts` (`complianceGroupReviewState`), `app/compliance/index.tsx` (`markTripVerified` returns success), `ComplianceTripsTable.tsx` (prop type)
- **Migrations:** none
- **Tested:** Jest `features/tripCompliance` (438 pass, incl. new group-state tests); `tsc` adds no new errors (141 already in V1); ESLint clean on touched files. Web UI not yet clicked through.

## 1. Baseline — Vasanth sir's V1

- **Source:** `Vasanthgogox/Pulse-app` → `V1` at `80589762448009f6a8b61d6a1a0d84998b037477`
- **Last commit:** `80589762 fix(infra): shared origin circuit + batch-query fail-fast for DB pressure`
- Starting point for everything below.

## 2. Adhi fixes → V1 `a8f87e08` (2026-09-23)

Branch `new-fix-adhi` (`e49fb71f..06416244`), squashed onto the baseline:

- `e49fb71f` Requests Moderator for DB request efficiency
- `c45ce127` finance: correct `LEDGER_TX_COLUMNS` to the real `transactions` columns
- `dba895ba` analytics: restore the PermissionGate `mode` prop name
- `06416244` netlify: exempt `VITE_*` public Supabase vars from secrets scanning

Conflicts resolved:
- `lib/supabase.ts`: kept V1's circuit breaker; the moderator wraps V1's fetch.
- `logPods.service.ts`: kept V1's courier/AWB handling (avoids a duplicate POD RPC).
- `tripComplianceRead.service.ts`: kept V1's typed fallback.

**`a8f87e08` is the baseline Praveen and Sneha branched from.**

Full detail of Adhi's changes: [Appendix](#appendix--adhi-fixes-detail-original-new-fix-adhi-changelog).

Also on V1 after this: `149fba7d` and `8c28bf9c` (team git workflow doc only, no code).

## 3. Praveen — compliance flow

**Branch:** `v0.0.01-v1-praveen-compliance-e2e-20260925-1530`, from V1 `8c28bf9c` + `praveen/compliance-flow` @ `1587f72d` (merge `c78a1190`, no conflicts). *Branch deleted 2026-09-25; commits are in V1.*
It supersedes the earlier squash branch `v0.0.01-v1-post-praveen-compliance-merge-20260923-1839` (`85e8a724`). That commit reached V1 through Praveen's `36fc60dc`, so the branch was a duplicate and has been deleted.

What it adds:
- One-tap **Verify Docs** on the compliance card and table: marks the trip compliance-verified once all required docs are approved.
- Trip vault: **Memo** document type, e-way bill upload, invoice number formatting, driver identity docs in trip detail.
- Loading slip and manifest removed from the required compliance document types.
- Vehicle document expiry: expired/expiring alerts; an expired doc moves the trip to Pending Docs.
- Compliance queue paging (30 per page) and document approval/status fixes.

**Migration:** `20270925110000_trip_documents_memo_type.sql` (allows `memo` on `trip_documents`). **Already applied on the preprod DB**; not yet checked on prod.

Checked: compliance/trips/drivers tests pass (560); tested end to end on preprod.

## 4. Sneha — compliance UI

**Branch:** `v0.0.01-v1-sneha-compliance-ui-merge-20260925-1553`, from step 3 + `sneha/compliance-ui` @ `ba9de198`. *Branch deleted 2026-09-25; commits are in V1.*
Sneha branched from `85e8a724`, so 7 files conflicted with Praveen's newer work. **Resolved by decision, not automatically:**

| Area | Kept |
|---|---|
| Compliance card | **Sneha's UI**, plus Praveen's one-tap Verify Docs (styled as her Pay button) and vehicle expiry alerts |
| Compliance screen | **Sneha's UI** (header subtitle removed), with Praveen's paging and fresh review data |
| Document review sheet | **Sneha's UI**: Pending/Verified columns, one Approve/Decline bar per group. Praveen's logic: vehicle docs are marked verified on approve, RC needs no expiry, Upload shows for any signed-in user. Trip verify happens from the card, so the sheet has no Mark Verified button |
| Table view | **Praveen's** |
| Review rules | Verified docs show no Approve/Decline (Praveen) |

Sneha's commits:
- `2cd2710a` compliance screen summary metrics and UI improvements
- `808db017` compliance components and new utility functions
- `530ffb4d` remove SummaryMetricCard, streamline the ComplianceScreen layout
- `ba9de198` `showAvatar` prop on PartyChip

Two of Sneha's checklist tests were updated from 6 to 5 trip documents (loading slip and manifest no longer exist).
No migrations.

Checked: compliance tests pass (238), navigation policy tests pass (64), lint clean on compliance files.
UI checked manually by Nihas before merging to V1.

## 5. → V1

**2026-09-25:** step 4 fast-forwarded into Nihas's `V1` at `787312c1` and pushed (deploys to GX Pulse preprod). Next: Vasanth sir merges it to prod (`Vasanthgogox/Pulse-app` `V1`).

### Known open items before prod
- Type check has 29 errors repo-wide. Most were already on V1; 2 come from Praveen's code (`useComplianceTripsQuery.ts` duplicate key, `tripComplianceRead.service.ts` null argument).
- Lint errors in `TripDetailScreen.tsx` (unused imports/vars) from Praveen's code.
- Apply the memo migration on the **prod DB** before Praveen's code goes live.
- The review sheet no longer shows a document's expiry date or upload file name (dropped with Sneha's UI). Expiry is still prompted on upload and enforced by the card alerts.

### Branch cleanup (2026-09-25)

After the merge into V1, these merge branches were deleted locally and on origin. Every commit in them is in `V1`, so nothing was lost:

| Branch | Tip | Reached V1 via |
|---|---|---|
| `v0.0.01-v1-post-praveen-compliance-merge-20260923-1839` | `85e8a724` | Praveen's `36fc60dc` |
| `v0.0.01-v1-praveen-compliance-e2e-20260925-1530` | `c78a1190` | fast-forward to `787312c1` |
| `v0.0.01-v1-sneha-compliance-ui-merge-20260925-1553` | `787312c1` | fast-forward |

To look at one again: `git log <tip>` (the commits are still in V1).

## Appendix — Adhi fixes detail (original `new-fix-adhi` changelog)

DB request efficiency work: a Requests Moderator gateway, query-shape fixes,
and a pass over the repo's failing test / typecheck / lint gates.

**No database or schema changes.** No migrations, no SQL, no edits to remote
schema. Everything here is client-side.

| Gate | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Jest | 2386 passing / 28 failing, 10 failing suites | **2418 passing / 0 failing, 319/319 suites** |
| Typecheck | 250 errors | **0** |
| Lint | 139 errors / 347 warnings | 95 errors / 351 warnings |
| `madge --circular` | 8 | 8 (unchanged — none added) |
| Web production build | — | passes |

The test total rises from 2414 to 2418 because four suites previously failed to
*run* (ESM parse errors, a missing test wrapper), so their cases were never
counted. Nothing was added to inflate the number.

---

### 1. Requests Moderator (new)

`lib/platform/moderator/` — ~640 LOC + ~680 LOC of tests. Fills the
`packages/platform/gateway` role that was previously a README stub
("Every client request enters here. Implementation: TBD").

Sits **below** TanStack Query and **above** `supabase()`. It is not a cache and
does not duplicate query state — it governs the request *stream*:

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| Concurrency ceiling | Semaphore bounding in-flight DB requests per device (default 6) |
| Priority lanes | `interactive` / `background` / `bulk`; background yields under load |
| Coalescing | Duplicate in-flight reads collapse to one round-trip |
| Circuit breaker | Sheds background/bulk on repeated 5xx / statement timeouts |
| Shape guard | Flags unbounded and `select=*` reads in dev |
| Invalidation debounce | Batches realtime-driven `invalidateQueries` on a ~100 ms window |

**Ships inert.** `observeOnly: true` by default: it counts everything and
governs nothing, so it lands with no behaviour change. Rollout order and the
config lines to enable each stage are in
[`docs/DB_LOAD_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`](docs/DB_LOAD_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md) §4.

#### Files
- `types.ts` — config + metrics shapes
- `requestModerator.ts` — semaphore, lanes, coalescing, breaker
- `requestClassifier.ts` — derives lane / coalesce key / shape violations from the PostgREST URL
- `invalidationScheduler.ts` — invalidation debouncer
- `moderatedFetch.ts` — for Edge Function calls that bypass the supabase-js client
- `index.ts` — public surface

#### Wiring
- `lib/supabase.ts` — moderated `global.fetch`. Auth, storage and realtime
  bypass moderation deliberately (queuing a token refresh behind data reads is
  how a recovering client deadlocks).
- `lib/platform/scalability/platformHealth.ts` — moderator counters exposed via
  `getPlatformHealthSnapshot()`.

#### Coverage
Verified by an integration test driving a real `supabase-js` client, not by
inspection: `.from().select()`, `.rpc()`, insert/update/delete, and
`.functions.invoke()` all pass through. The 3 raw `fetch()` calls to Edge
Functions (`validate-gstin`, `penny-drop`, `biometric-verify`) were converted to
`moderatedFetch`. A repo grep for raw fetch against the Supabase backend now
returns none.

**Known accepted bypass:** `app/audit/index.tsx` builds its own client from a
CDN script. Web-only dev diagnostic, not in the mobile bundle.

#### Write-path safety (defect found during the coverage audit)
Writes were eligible for a caller-supplied `background`/`bulk` lane, so an open
circuit breaker could **shed a write** — losing a trip status, payment or POD.
Now any non-GET/HEAD request is forced into `interactive` and is never
coalesced. Locked by `__tests__/writeSafety.test.ts`.

---

### 2. Query efficiency

- **`features/finance/services/finance.service.ts`** — ledger reads select ~19
  explicit columns instead of `select("*")` on the widest, hottest table.
  `getTripLedgerEmbed` wrapped in `runSingleflight` so a realtime burst across
  distinct trips shares one in-flight request per trip.
  **Deliberately left unbounded:** `getAllTransactionsByOrganizationForTotals`.
  A row cap was attempted and reverted — the Cash tab's grand total must reflect
  every row, with filtered totals derived client-side from that complete set.
  Capping silently truncates headline figures for large orgs (a previously
  confirmed release blocker, guarded by its own test). The proper fix is a
  server-side SUM aggregate, which needs a migration and is out of scope.
- **`lib/queries/useRealtimeInvalidation.ts`** — trips and transactions
  invalidation bursts routed through the debouncer.
- **`useClientsQuery` / `useSuppliersQuery` / `useDriversQuery`** —
  `STALE.moderate` → `STALE.slow`. These are near-static lookups already
  invalidated by mutations and realtime, so no freshness is lost.

---

### 3. Bugs found and fixed

Each of these was surfaced by a gate that had been failing long enough to look
like noise.

| Bug | Impact |
|---|---|
| `DriverLevelProgressionScreen` called `subscribeSharedPostgresChanges` without importing it | Screen would throw as soon as a driver's IDs resolved |
| `trip_compliance.*` surfaces used `anyOfCaps` as both the org gate **and** the grant set | Granting a **finance** member the Compliance tab also conferred `dispatch` + `dispatch_for_own_fleet` (privilege leak). Fixed with explicit `grantsCaps`; logged in `docs/RBAC_OPERATING_MODEL_CHANGELOG.md` |
| `markSelectedTripsHardCopyPodReceived` passed a timestamp where POD metadata was expected (2 call sites) | Courier name and AWB the user typed were **silently discarded** on every bulk POD mark |
| `MAP_PING_DOT_HTML` referenced but never defined | GPS ping marker would throw on web maps. Constant recovered from `6ba500e6` |
| `invoiceCnDn.service.ts` imported `../invoicing.service` | Wrong path — the module is a sibling (`./`) |
| `/reach/inbox` route had no navigation-policy entry | Route shipped with no access rules attached |

---

### 4. Typecheck: 250 → 0

**One line caused 202 of the 250.** Two web-only CSS properties
(`outlineStyle: "none"`) in `PodReconciliationScreen.tsx` broke
`StyleSheet.create`'s type inference, so *every* `styles.*` reference in that
2,400-line file reported "No overload matches this call". Cast via `object`,
matching the repo's existing pattern for web-only CSS.

The remaining ~48 were spread thin. Representative fixes:

- **Derived fields typed as such** — `execution_plan_id` added as optional to
  `TripRow` and `IndentRow`. It is resolved at read time from joined indents;
  it is **not** a column on `trips` or `indents` (verified against
  `database.types.ts` and the migration history).
- **Signatures widened to match runtime** — `isTripCompleted`,
  `resolveGiveLoadClient`, `indentDisplayOriginDest` all declared
  `Pick<Row, …>` but callers legitimately pass nullable values the bodies
  already normalize.
- **`groupInvoiceRevenueCnDn` made generic** so callers passing the richer
  `TripAdjustment` keep `trip_id` through to the edit callback.
- **`chatDocumentHub.service.ts`** — keys cast to `VehicleComplianceDocType`
  instead of `keyof VehicleDocuments`; the latter includes `extras: []`, which
  widened every entry and broke `.url` / `.uploadedAt`.
- **`DriverWorkOpportunityCard`** — `withWebSafeShadows` wraps a *stylesheet*,
  not a single entry; restructured to the repo pattern.
- **Story viewers** — passed `originParts`/`destinationParts` objects to a
  component whose props take raw strings.

---

### 5. Test infrastructure

- **`__mocks__/@sentry/react-native.js` (new)** — the real SDK ships
  untranspiled ESM, so any test transitively importing `lib/crashReporter.ts`
  died with `Unexpected token 'export'` when run in isolation.
- **`jest.config.js`** — maps that mock; adds `moti`, `react-native-reanimated`,
  `lottie-react-native`, `@motify` to `transformIgnorePatterns` (same ESM issue,
  hit by any test rendering a screen that imports them).
- **`eslint.config.cjs`** — `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` off for test
  files. Jest hoists `jest.mock()` factories above the import block, so
  `require()` inside one is the documented pattern, not a lapse.

#### Tests updated to match current behaviour
Four assertions encoded superseded designs and were failing because the code had
moved on, not because it was wrong:
- `quoted` status moved from the Quoted tab to Open (migration `20270128103100`)
- Sponsored story posts sort **first** (monetization ordering)
- Indent surfaces re-parented to `tripops.tab` (prevents a Trip Ops member
  unlocking the whole Network tab)
- Sign-in footer link now routes to the onboarding hub, not the suite sign-up href

Stale mocks were also repaired where production had added a DB call or a
recovery branch the test didn't queue a response for.

**Open item:** `tripops.pulse_loads` still parents to `sales.tab` while its
eight sibling indent surfaces parent to `tripops.tab`. Confirmed intentional
(it's the loads-hub landing screen inside the Network tab) — the catalog
integrity test carries a documented exemption rather than papering over it.

---

### 6. Lint: 139 → 95 errors

Auto-fixable unused imports removed; 13 unused function args prefixed with `_`
(destructured props written as `name: _name` so the property lookup survives);
one genuinely dead local removed.

**Stopped here by decision.** The remaining 95 are judgment calls, not breakage:
- **44 `pulse/file-naming`** — cosmetic renames (`*.util.ts` / `*.service.ts`
  suffixes) touching 34 import sites. Wide diff, high conflict risk.
- **30 unused vars** — whole dead functions/components in product files
  (`TableStatusCell`, `renderDesktopStatusTabs`, `publishDispatchEvents`).
  Each has exactly one reference: its own declaration. Some may be unfinished
  work rather than abandoned, so deleting them is a product call.
- **21 `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`** — mostly Edge Functions. Needs a
  real type per call site; a wrong type is worse than `any` because it reads as
  a guarantee.

---

### 7. Docs

- `docs/DB_LOAD_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` (new) — the architecture review,
  coverage audit, rollout plan and smoke-test results.
- `docs/RBAC_OPERATING_MODEL_CHANGELOG.md` — entry for the `trip_compliance`
  capability-leak fix, as the repo's RBAC process requires.

---

### Verification

All numbers above were measured, and the "before" figures were confirmed by
re-running each gate with these changes stashed.

Two caveats worth carrying forward:
1. One full-suite run reported a failure that turned out to be a Jest worker
   `SIGSEGV` under memory pressure, not a regression — a re-run with
   `--maxWorkers=2` passed cleanly. The suite can flake this way under load.
2. The per-screen request counts in the architecture review come from static
   analysis, not runtime traces. Phase 2 (observe-only) should confirm the real
   profile before the concurrency ceiling is tuned to specific numbers.
