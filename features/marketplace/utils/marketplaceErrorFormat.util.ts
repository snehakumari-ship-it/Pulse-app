/**
 * A9.2 — single shared translation for Marketplace bid-transaction RPC
 * errors. submit_market_bid / accept_market_bid (Market) and
 * submit_driver_direct_bid / accept_driver_direct_bid (Reach) deliberately
 * share the same `code: message` exception convention (established in
 * A6.3), so one formatter correctly covers both mechanisms' submission and
 * award/reject paths -- do not duplicate this mapping per screen.
 *
 * Never displays a raw error code/prefix or Postgres text to a user.
 * Always returns display text only -- callers that need the original
 * message for logging/debugging already have it (this function doesn't
 * consume or discard it).
